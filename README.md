# Exylium
Exylium. System to upload code to different development boards: Esp8266, Esp32 among others using USB ports. It was originally created to upload a code on several boards at the same time. For example: I connect 1 esp8266 to each port and upload the code. And it charges to all 3 ports at the same time. It is super useful when having to upload the same .bin code to 5 boards at the same time or more.
